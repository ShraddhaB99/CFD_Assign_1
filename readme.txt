The progamming language used is Python and the program aims to produce results for one of the initial 
solutions given (total five in number) at one time. When the program is run, it asks the user for the value
of 'CFL' which is the CFL(Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy ) number. In the window, it is displayed which number is to be
entered for producing the results for a particular initial solution.And the graph will be plotted.
